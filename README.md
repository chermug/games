CHERMUG games
=====

The CHERMUG project aims to develop a game to support students as they develop an understanding of research methods and statistics. The inductive and hypothetico-deductive reasoning that underlie research methodology require logical reasoning and critical thinking skills that are core competences in developing a more sophisticated understanding of the world. 

For full description of the project please see : http://www.chermug.eu/

There are games for both quantitive and qualitative games both as stand alone and as SCORM packages.
